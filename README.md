# Road accident dashboard

This project aims to develop a comprehensive road accident dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, providing valuable insights into various accident-related metrics for our client. The primary focus is on the Total Casualties resulting from accidents, serving as a fundamental Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Additionally, the dashboard will break down Total Casualties in relation to accident severity, highlighting the percentage of casualties within each severity category, and identifying the maximum casualties by type of vehicle involved.

Secondary KPIs include a breakdown of Total Casualties based on vehicle types, allowing for a deeper understanding of accident dynamics. The dashboard will also present a monthly trend analysis, facilitating a year-on-year comparison of casualties for the Current Year and Previous Year, aiding in identifying patterns and trends.

Furthermore, the dashboard will provide insights into accident dynamics by showcasing maximum casualties based on road types and distributing total casualties across different road surfaces. Lastly, the relationship between Casualties and factors such as area/location and day/night conditions will be explored, offering a comprehensive overview of the accident scenarios. Overall, the dashboard will empower our client with data-driven decision-making capabilities to enhance road safety measures.
